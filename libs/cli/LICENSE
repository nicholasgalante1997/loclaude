Addendum, January 19, 2026

This package leverages the [Bun](bun.sh) shell to run shell commands on behalf of the end user.  

In an ideal world, I don't have to write this addendum. In this world, I do.  

If you pass unsanitized input into this command line tool, all bets are off. I'll make no guarantees on your behalf about behavior or safety. I'll personally never talk to you in real life. May god have mercy on your soul.
